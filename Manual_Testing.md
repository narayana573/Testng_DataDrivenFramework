#### Manual Testing

> <b>Smoke testing</b> is a wide approach where all areas of the software application are tested without getting into too deep.
 
> <b>sanitysoftware testing</b> is a narrow regression testing with a focus on one or a small set of areas of functionality of the software application.

> <b>Retesting</b> is done to make sure that the tests cases which failed in last execution are passing after the defects against those failures are fixed.

> <b>Regression testing</b> is not carried out on specific defect fixes. ... InRegression testing, you can include the test cases which passed earlier.


> <b>Test Case:</b> A TEST CASE is a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application. A Test Case contains test steps, test data, precondition, postcondition developed for specific test scenario to verify any requirement.


> <b>Test Suite:</b> as “validation suite,” a test suite is a collection of various test cases that are intended to test a software product or its specific functionality/feature, once the software development is accomplished.


> <b>Severity:</b> Defect Severity is defined as the degree of impact that a defect has on the operation of the product

**Severity is categorized into five types**
* Critical
* Major
* Moderate
* Minor
* Cosmetic


> <b>Priority:</b> Defect Priority has defined the order in which the developer should resolve a defect

**Priority is categorized into three types**
* Low
* Medium
* High





## Test Plan vs Test Strategy (Interview Notes)

### Test Plan

- **Definition**: A detailed document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.
- **Objective**: To outline how testing will be carried out for a specific project.
- **Prepared by**: Test Lead / QA Manager
- **Scope**:
  - Test objectives
  - Test items (features to be tested)
  - Types of testing (Functional, Regression, Smoke, etc.)
  - Testing schedule & milestones
  - Entry and Exit criteria
  - Resources and responsibilities
  - Risk identification & mitigation
  - Tools to be used

- **Project-specific**: Yes
- **Example**: Test plan for an e-commerce checkout feature

---

### Test Strategy

- **Definition**: A high-level document that outlines the general approach and principles for testing across the organization or program.
- **Objective**: To define the overall testing approach and standards to be followed.
- **Prepared by**: QA Manager / Test Architect
- **Scope**:
  - Testing approach for all phases
  - Test levels and test types
  - Test environment setup
  - Defect management process
  - Automation strategy
  - Metrics and reporting standards

- **Project-specific**: No (applies across multiple projects)
- **Example**: Organization-wide test strategy defining how automation will be handled across all products

### Key Differences

| Aspect            | Test Plan                        | Test Strategy                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Level             | Project level                    | Organization or program level          |
| Prepared by       | Test Lead / QA Manager           | QA Manager / Test Architect            |
| Focus             | What, when, who, and how of testing for a project | Overall testing principles and approach |
| Dynamic/Static    | Dynamic – changes per project    | Static – rarely changes                |
| Detail            | Detailed & actionable            | High-level & directional               |
